Revision 1		   posnk code convention		      16/02/2015

1. Source file layout

	Each source file must start with a header comment containing doxygen 
	information, a line indicating the project it is part of, a changelog 
	and a license insertion point.

	Source files are divided into sections seperated by single line C style
	comments, these sections may only contain a single kind of construct (an
	exception to this rule are function-local typedefs such as those used to
	pass iterator parameters), internal functions are to be kept in a 
	separate section from public functions.
		
	Source files are to be kept as small as is possible without obscuring 
	the mechanisms contained by them.

	Includes are to be grouped into library references and project
	references, further grouping according to module is recommended when 
	there are a large number of includes.

2. Naming
	
	Names are in the underscore (snake_case) convention. 

	All global symbols are to be named <module>[_int]_<name>, all typedefs 
	are to be postfixed with _t, likewise all structs are to be postfixed 
	with _s.

	Macro names are capitalized and configuration macros are to be prefixed 
	by CONFIG_ except for platform-selection macros which are to be named 
	ARCH_<PLATFORM_NAME>

3. Comments
	
	All global definitions are required to be documented by doxygen comments
	containing a brief description for the construct and its parameters, 
	errors and return values.

	In-code comments should be on seperate lines where possible and should 
	only use C-style block comments (/**/).

4. Function definitions

	Functions which can reasonably be expected to fail are required to 
	return a status code of type errno_t and should pass any return value
	via a pointer parameter.


5. Whitespaces and line-breaks
	
	Indentation should use the <TAB> character.

	Braces for conditional statements and structure definitions should be on
	the line containing the definiton, braces for functions must be on the 
	first line following the definition.
