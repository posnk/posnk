/**
 * @defgroup stream Stream API
 * @brief Implements the UNIX file API ( fd streams )
 *
 * The streams programming interface provides an unified way of transferring
 * data. It wraps the VFS API and implements pipes. For files it keeps track
 * of the current offset.
 *
 * Slightly different terminology is used here:
 *
 * UNIX - POSNK
 * @li File description - stream info
 * @li File descriptor - stream pointer
 * @li File (opened) - stream
